# Kubernetes Core Components and Concepts

This document provides an overview of the core Kubernetes components and their descriptions. Use this guide to understand the building blocks of Kubernetes.

## Core Concepts

| **Component**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pod**                 | The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object representing a set of running containers in your cluster. |
| **ReplicaSet (RS)**      | Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.                          |
| **ReplicationController (RC)** | Similar to ReplicaSet but with older and less flexible functionality. Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running. |
| **Deployment**           | Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. Manages application lifecycle including image use, pod replicas, and updates. |
| **StatefulSet**          | Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, ensuring ordering and uniqueness. Used for stateful applications. |
| **DaemonSet**            | Ensures that all (or specific) nodes run a copy of a Pod. Pods are added as nodes are added to the cluster. |
| **Job**                  | Creates one or more Pods and ensures a specified number of them successfully terminate. Used for batch processing. |
| **CronJob**              | Manages time-based job scheduling, similar to Unix cron jobs.                                      |
| **Service**              | Abstracts and exposes an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.                |
| **Ingress**              | Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Provides load balancing, SSL termination, and virtual hosting. |
| **ConfigMap**            | Injects configuration data into applications.                                                     |
| **Secret**               | Stores and manages sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.           |
| **Volume**               | Manages data storage for containers.                                                              |
| **PersistentVolume (PV)**| Cluster provisioned storage.                                                                      |

| **Node**                 | Worker machine in Kubernetes (can be a VM or physical machine).                                    |
| **Label**                | Key/value pairs attached to objects for organization and selection.                               |
| **Annotation**           | Attaches arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects.                                           |
| **Controller**           | A control loop that watches the state of the cluster and adjusts it to the desired state.         |
| **Node Affinity**        | Defines rules to constrain pod placement on particular nodes based on labels.                     |
| **Probes**               | Checks the health of containers within a pod.                                                     |
