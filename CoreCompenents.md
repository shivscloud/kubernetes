Here's a beautifully formatted and professional **GitHub README.md** for your **Kubernetes Core Components** section:

# 🚀 Kubernetes Core Components  

A **Kubernetes cluster** consists of a **Control Plane** and one or more **Worker Nodes**. Below is a structured overview of its **core components**:

---

## ⚙️ **Control Plane Components**  
The **Control Plane** manages the overall state of the cluster and makes global decisions about its operation.  

| Component               | Description  |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **🖥️ kube-apiserver**  | Exposes the Kubernetes API, serving as the front-end of the cluster. |
| **🗂️ etcd**  | A distributed key-value store that persistently holds all cluster data. |
| **📌 kube-scheduler**  | Assigns new Pods to available nodes based on resource availability and constraints. |
| **📢 kube-controller-manager**  | Runs various controllers to ensure the desired cluster state is maintained. |
| **☁️ cloud-controller-manager (optional)**  | Manages interactions with cloud providers for load balancers, networking, and storage. |

---

## 🔧 **Node Components**  
Worker nodes run containerized applications and maintain the Kubernetes **runtime environment**.  

| Component               | Description  |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **🔍 kubelet**  | Ensures that containers in a Pod are running as expected. |
| **🌐 kube-proxy (optional)**  | Manages network rules to facilitate Kubernetes Service communication. |
| **📦 Container Runtime**  | Executes containers. Examples include **containerd, CRI-O, and Docker**. |

💡 *Each node may also require additional software, such as `systemd`, to manage system services on Linux-based deployments.*

---

## 🛠️ **Addons**  
Enhance your cluster with additional **Kubernetes Addons**, such as:  
✅ **DNS** – CoreDNS for service discovery  
✅ **Ingress Controllers** – Manage HTTP and HTTPS traffic  
✅ **Monitoring** – Prometheus, Grafana, and logging solutions
